I want to blog. I created my first blog using [WordPress][wordpress] in 2009.
It's long time gone, but you can still find [sites linking to
it][google-dagrevis.net]. Some time after that I finally learned enough
programming to make a blog from the ground up. Back then I used [PHP][php] and
I'm grateful I still have [the source code][dagrevislv-php] with me. It's
a good memory from my early code. In 2012 I decided to learn [Python][python].
I created [daGrevis.lv][dagrevislv] where I used to blog in Latvian. It's time
to start a new blog.

I chose [Jekyll][jekyll] because I wanted a static site. For blogs like this
you don't actually need to have server that regenerates page on every request.
It just doesn't make sense for blog posts. I tried other alternatives to Jekyll
like [Pelican][pelican] and [Wintersmith][Wintersmith], but at the end decided
to stick with Jekyll because it's popular, proven and works fine for my needs.
Somewhere in between I even managed to write [my own static site
generator][squirrel]. It's just a thing I do. I hack on things because I find
it fun.

Static sites are especially appealing to programmers. You can write blog post
in the same editor you write your code. It means you can write your
[Markdown][markdown] blog posts in Vim if you are into that. Deployment is
a breeze. You can clone the Git repo, make a change, and push to deploy. You
can even make [an edit through GitHub][dagrev.is-pr] to quickly fix important
typo from your iPhone. And because everything is in Git, you have [full
history][dagrev.is-history] of whole project for free.

I wanted to make my blog look good so I started with beautiful fonts. I'm using
[Franklin Gothic][franklin] for body text and [Montserrat][montserrat] for
headlines. I think they go well together. For monospaced font I'm using
[Inconsolata][inconsolata], the same font I use when I'm coding. I prefer big
letters and a lot of whitespace because it improves readability and looks
great. I didn't want to risk with colors so I went with [flat UI color
palette][flatui]. Finally I made a logo by adding [Root icon][noun-root] and
[Star icon][noun-star] together. I can't recommend [Noun Project][noun] enough,
they are my go-to site for vector icons!

A few days ago I saw ["Inside the mind of a master procrastinator" TED
talk][ted-procrastinator] and it got me thinking. I suddenly felt pretty guilty
about delaying blogging for so long. The next day I received an invoice for
[daGrev.is][dagrev.is] domain name. Yes, I had a blog available for a whole
year, but I'm writing my first blog post just now. That was the deadline
I needed. I will write **at least a single post every month** from now on. It
may not be pretty at start, but I have to start somewhere.

I will be writing about thoughts I find curious. I might share my newest toy
project with you. I might write about my experience with some new developer
tool I have used recently. I might try to explain why I think some ways of
doing programming are better than others. I might even tell you a story about
crazy bugs I have seen and fixed. Thank you for reading! [Follow me on
