My real name is **Raitis Stengrevics**, but I always go by **daGrevis** on the
internet. I live in [Riga, Latvia][riga] and currently work at [E-Global Trade
& Finance Group][eg] on a web-based forex trading platform called
[Share4you][s4u]. I'm very passionate [about programming][github-dagrevis] and
the way things work, and I love [to tweet][twitter-dagrevis] about my
experiences and findings!

Most of my time I write code in [Python][python] and [JavaScript][javascript],
but lately I have also been experimenting with [Clojure](clojure) and
[functional programming][fp] in general. I like to learn about different
approaches in solving problems because there's always a better way to do
something. A few things I have made in my spare time include source code for
[this][dagrev.is] and [my other blog][dagrevis.lv], [link recognition
plugin][mdx-linkify] for Markdown, framework agnostic [caching
library][sweetcache], [static site generator][squirrel], p2p chat for web
[here][hendrix-chat] and [here][hndrx-chat], and [my awesome
dotfiles][dotfiles].

the time)
