My real name is **Raitis Stengrevics**, but I always go by **daGrevis** on the
internet. I live in [Riga, Latvia][riga] and currently work at [E-Global Trade &
Finance Group][eg] on a web-based forex trading platform called
[Share4you][s4u]. I'm very passionate [about programming](github-dagrevis) and
the way things work, and I love [to tweet][twitter-dagrevis] about my
experiences and findings!

Most of my time I write code in [Python][python] and [JavaScript][javascript],
but lately I have been experimenting with [Clojure](clojure) and [functional
programming][fp] too. I'm eager to try new things I find interesting and
fortunately there's tons of stuff out there! Some of stuff I have open-sourced
myself include source code for [this][dagrev.is] and [my other
blog][dagrevis.lv], [link recognition plugin][mdx-linkify] for Python Markdown,
secure [peer-to-peer chat][hendrix-chat] for web and [my awesome
dotfiles][dotfiles].

(to be honest, I don't really wear suits and my beard isn't that wild most of
the time)
