My real name is **Raitis Stengrevics**, but I always go by **daGrevis** on the
internet. I live in [Riga, Latvia][riga] with my girlfriend. Currently I work at
[OrangeLV][orangelv] as a software developer. I have always been very passionate
[about programming][github-dagrevis] and the way things work. I love [listening
to music][lastfm-dagrevis] and traveling abroad.

Most of my time I write code in
[JavaScript][javascript]/[TypeScript][typescript] nowadays. I'm also proficient
in [Python][python] and I have hands-on experience with [Clojure][clojure],
[Lua][lua], [PHP][php], [VimL][viml] and more. I like to learn about different
approaches in solving problems because there's always a better way to do
something. All the code I can share can be found on [my
GitHub][github-dagrevis].
